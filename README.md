Two of the key columns have the headings PACT and Build to Preserve.

PACT, the heading for the second column, is an Orwellian acronym for Permanent Affordability Commitment Together. PACT was an Agency code name used to replace Rental Assistance Demonstration, or RAD.

Build to Preserve is also an Orwellian Agency term meant to refer to infill development (real estate development of children's playgrounds, parking lots, and green spaces and gardens). Infill development may come about as a result of demolition and Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, or MIH, rezoning of demolished or vacant lots.

Build to Preserve in this spreadsheet includes the sale of air rights (which the Ageny also refers to as Transfer to Preserve).
